    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
      using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
      the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
      translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The
      app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
      <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong> is committed to ensuring that the
      app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
      the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
      time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
      services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying
      for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Daily Flare</strong> app stores and processes personal data
      that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your
      responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
      therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, as it
      could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs and
      compromise your phone’s security.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet & Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that
      <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong> will not take responsibility for.
      Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection.
      The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider,
      but <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong> cannot take responsibility for
      the app not working if you don’t have internet access or run out of data
      allowance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile provider may
      charge you for data usage. You accept responsibility for any such charges,
      including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
      country. If you are not the bill payer for the device, we assume you have
      received permission from the bill payer to use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Device & Battery Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong> cannot always take responsibility
      for the way you use the app. You need to ensure that your device stays
      charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t access the Service,
      <strong>Süleyman Gökhan Birkin</strong> cannot accept responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>

      Conditions. Below are links to their policies:

      available on iOS – the system requirements may change, and you’ll need to

      will always work with all iOS versions.
